Build a 5 person team using only the best players from the vct-international bracket. Assign roles to each player and explain why this composition would be effective in a competitive match. Consider all players, regions, agents, and past matches when building the team. Ensure that the team composition is balanced in terms of roles, has exactly one in-game leader(IGL), and is in the correct bracket. Consider factors such as team synergy, individual skill, winrate, KDA, win rate, clutches, first bloods, etc. For each player, provide statistics that clearly prove that player is the best in their respective role. Compare all players against each other and select only the top players to be part of the team. After generating the team, give a detailed analysis for each player on the team, why they were chosen, and how they compare to other players that were not selected. Please consider all past games. The players can play any agents and be from any region.
