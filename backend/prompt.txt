Build a team using only the best players from the vct-international bracket. Assign roles to each player and explain why this composition would be effective in a competitive match. Consider all players, regions, agents, and past matches when building the team. Ensure that the team composition is balanced in terms of roles, has exactly one in-game leader(IGL), and is in the correct bracket. Consider factors such as team synergy, individual skill, winrate, KDA, win rate, clutches, first bloods, etc. Also ensure that the team includes one player who uses the Operator as one of their top 2 primaries.
