Here’s a hypothetical Valorant roster composed of tier 2 players. These players have shown immense talent and potential but haven't consistently broken into the top tier yet. They’re often seen performing well in regional competitions or on the cusp of becoming top-tier stars:

Duelist: xms (Karmine Corp)

A mechanically gifted player with experience in several FPS titles. xms has shown strong performances, particularly on agents like Jett and Raze, and is capable of high-impact plays.
Initiator: Jonaaa6 (Leviatán)

Known for his solid utility usage on agents like Sova and Skye, Jonaaa6 has demonstrated strong decision-making and a potential to break into the top-tier scene.
Controller: Zander (Oxygen Esports)

A very capable controller player, Zander excels on agents like Viper and Omen. His leadership and strategic depth have often led his teams to competitive performances.
Sentinel: Trick (M80)

A well-rounded sentinel player who has been on the rise. His Killjoy and Cypher setups are disciplined and effective, giving his team strong defensive capabilities.
Flex: Tex (The Guard)

A versatile player who can flex between duelists and initiators, Tex is known for his adaptability and ability to clutch in high-pressure situations.
Coach: Onur (ex-Leviatán)
Onur is known for his strong leadership and coaching, having helped develop several talented players in the South American scene. His experience could help guide this roster to unlock its full potential.
This team balances aggressive plays with solid utility and a strategic mindset. While these players might not be the biggest names in tier 1, they’ve shown potential and could make a strong push into higher-tier competition with the right coaching and synergy.
